## The high level todo list:

- Implement the GPIO input
- Look into the flash issue
- Implement all the web features.
- Add an option to use a simcard if no wifi is availble where you are.
- Comment the code!!!

Later on options to think about:

- System is already modular for main features (input, ui). Maybe I should work on a "modules" system to add the needed module not included in Pimaton code (eg: building a custom UI)
- Use CV2 to be able to work with additional camera
