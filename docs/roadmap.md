      - ~~Touchscreen input to start process~~
      - ~~Make it pretty (stuff I don't like/know how to do :P)~~
      - ~~Put a picture (either 1st taken pic or an animated gif) on the processing screen~~

      - ~~Implement a "statistics" area in the header (eg: "X pic has been taken since Pimaton starter")~~
  - ~~Add PiCamera overlay (countdown between pictures)~~

  - ~~CLI option to run Pimaton only once (to integrate into scripts)~~
  - ~~QR code link to a website (eg: webgallery of all pictures of the night)~~
